# The-Calculus-Road

Journey through calculus for children and other curious folks of all ages.


## Planned structure

- theory booklet, side roads on left-side pages, main line on right pages (frontal)
- exercises for each section in separate booklet. Minimal text there? Or bind the two together in a flexible 'web way': turn it on or off at will?
- still pondering how to approach these:
  + educator notes: what to watch for when doing exercises: what smart people might do and which of those 'being smart to be lazy' self-discovered tricks can lead someone astray in a later phase. (Should I add this to the theory booklet, so anyone can take this and run with it on their own, "no educator required" kinda style?)
  + "language": these texts are aimed at the ones who *want* to learn, the ones who are fundamentally curious, the ones who *need to know __why__*: language is a fundamental part of calculus as it drives our reasoning. Hence this text will seek to enhance the reader's passive vocabulary -- how to format the 'advanced verbiage' and integrate it unobstrusively in the main text, so people can click and learn side tracks where their curiosity leads them.
